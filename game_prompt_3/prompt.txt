Considering this game requirements, I need you to create a ZIP file with all the necessary files and its complete content to run the game. No explanations are needed, just the file.

Development Environment: Create the game using Python (version to be specified, e.g., Python 3.8 or later).

Game Content:

Utilize a JSON file containing 15 well-researched multiple-choice questions and answers. The topics of these questions should cover a diverse range of subjects to ensure a broad appeal.
Ensure the questions are of varying difficulty levels to maintain player engagement and challenge.
Main Game File:

Name the primary script game.py.
This script should be executable and well-commented for clarity.
Player Interaction:

Initiate the game by prompting the player to enter their name.
Implement a user-friendly interface for question display and answer input.
Game Mechanics:

Design a random question selection mechanism to fetch questions from the JSON file.
Set a game rule where consecutive wrong answers (2 in total) result in a game loss.
Implement a winning condition where correctly answering 5 questions (not necessarily consecutive) leads to a victory.
End-Game Scenarios:

Display a congratulatory message upon winning.
Show the player’s performance statistics (e.g., number of correct/incorrect answers, percentage score) at the end of the game, regardless of the outcome.
History Tracking:

Update a separate JSON file, history.json, after each game session.
This file should include the player’s name, response statistics, and the date/time of the game.
Define and document the structure of history.json for future reference and potential scalability.
Code Organization:

Adhere to good programming practices, including readable and maintainable code.
Organize the code into functions or classes where appropriate to enhance modularity and readability.
Documentation and Comments:

Include inline comments and module-level documentation within the code for clarity and ease of maintenance.
Delivery Format:

Provide the entire project in a compressed ZIP file format, containing all necessary scripts and JSON files.
Additional Considerations:

Consider adding error handling for user inputs to improve game robustness.
Implement a simple but intuitive UI for a better user experience.
Optionally, include a brief README file outlining the game's basic instructions and system requirements.
