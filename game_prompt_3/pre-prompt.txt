Given this prompt that represents the requirements for a project that ChatGPT must solve I need you to enhance it as much as possible. Please keep the items-form.

"I need a game made in Python.
The game consists of a JSON file with 15 multiple-choice questions and answers that you will search for on the internet.
The game will run in game.py.
The game starts by asking the player's name.
Then we enter a loop of random questions obtained from the group of questions.
If the player answers 2 questions incorrectly in a row, they lose the game.
If the player answers 5 questions correctly (even if not consecutive), they win the game.
If they win, they will be shown a congratulatory message.
Whether they win or lose, the player's response statistics must be displayed.
Finally, you will update a JSON file called "history.json" with the player's data, response statistics, and the date and time they played.
You will define the format of "history.json" based on the provided data.
The game must be clearly programmed and follow good programming practices.
If you consider it necessary to separate into methods to make it more readable and maintainable, do so.

Give the whole project in a zip file, no explanations. Just the file."
